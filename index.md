Hi, I'm still working on this site so not everything is here yet. For
now, here's a few basics you might like to know. If you'd like to
enquire about lessons, please fill out
[this form](https://forms.gle/Ta4SvrFMJDYs1LTKA).

## Areas

I'm based in Edgeley, Stockport. The areas I cover include Edgeley, Cheadle Heath, Adswood, some of Cheadle, some of Bramhall, Davenport, Heaton Norris, and some of Heaton Moor. If you're nearby but unsure if I
cover your area, enquire and I'll let you know if I can help.

## Pricing

I charge £38/hour, and usually do either 2 hour lessons (£76) or 90
minute lessons (£57). If you think a different length lesson would suit
you better, please feel free to ask.

If you're a full licence holder, the same price as above still applies.
Please just let me know what your needs are when filling out the
[enquiry form](https://forms.gle/Ta4SvrFMJDYs1LTKA) (I don't currently
offer pass plus, however).

## Availability

I will be able to give more details about my current availability when
you enquire, but in general my diary is open from 7:30-17:30 Monday -
Friday, and I have some availability on Sunday afternoons. My diary is
flexible, so you do not have to have a set weekly slot, and can book
lessons whenever suits you (as long as I have the availability). 

## Car

I teach in a Renault Zoe (2021 ZE50). It's an electric car (automatic),
so if you want to drive a manual or need a manual licence, I won't be
the right instructor for you (sorry). If you want to experience the
[benefits of driving an EV](https://pod-point.com/guides/driver/benefits-of-electric-cars),
or just don't fancy having to deal with gears and a clutch, you're in
the right place!

Some photos and video of the car will be here very soon!
