Hi, I'm still working on this site so not everything is here yet. For
now, here's a few basics you might like to know. If you'd like to
enquire about lessons, please fill out
[this form](https://forms.gle/Ta4SvrFMJDYs1LTKA).

## Pricing

I charge £38/hour, and usually do either 2 hour lessons (£76) or 90
minute lessons (£57).

## Availability

I will be able to give more details about my current availability when
you enquire, but in general my diary is open from 7:30-17:30 Monday -
Friday, and I have some availability on Sunday afternoons. My diary is
flexible, so you do not have to have a set weekly slot, and can book
lessons whenever suits you (as long as I have the availability).

## Car

I teach in a Renault Zoe. It's an electric car, so if you do your
driving test in my car you'll get an automatic only licence.
