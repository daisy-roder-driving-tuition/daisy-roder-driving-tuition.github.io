# Daisy Roder Driving Tuition Terms and Conditions

## 1. Lesson bookings

Lessons may be booked directly with me, either by message, phone, or in person. Alternatively, I may offer the option to book lessons using a website or app. When a lesson is booked, you will receive a confirmation of the lesson date and time, either by text message, or in a third-party app if this has been made available to you and you have chosen to use it. A lesson should only be considered to be booked when you have received a confirmation or it is shown as booked in a diary system that has been made available to you.

I will arrive at the agreed address by the agreed lesson start time and make you aware that I am present. If due to unexpected circumstances I am late to the lesson, I will, if possible and if agreed with you, add on the missed time to the end of the lesson, or otherwise, refund you for the missed time. At the agreed lesson end time, we will finish at the address agreed beforehand, unless mutually agreed otherwise during the lesson.

## 2. Payments

Lessons must be paid for at least 48 hours before the lesson, except in cases where a lesson is booked within that time period, but in all cases payment must have been made by 30 minutes before the lesson start time. If payment is not received on time your lesson may be cancelled. Payments may be made by bank transfer, or any other method I have agreed with you prior to booking the lesson. 

Unused payments may be refunded at your request, or if you do not book any lessons for 1 year I will endeavour to refund any remaining unused payment. You will need to provide me with your bank details for me to refund any payments made by bank transfer.

## 3. Cancellations

If you wish to cancel a lesson you must give at least 48 hours notice before the lesson start time. If you cancel within this period I may charge you up to the full price you have paid for the lesson (exceptions may be made for illness etc. at my discretion). 

If for any reason I need to cancel or rearrange a lesson I will give you as much notice as possible and you will not be charged for the cancelled lesson.

## 4. Licence and fitness to drive

You must hold a valid UK full or provisional driving licence. Before your first lesson you must provide me with the required details to perform an online driving licence check. On your first lesson you must bring your provisional or full driving licence card for me to verify. It is your responsibility to let me know of any changes to your licence or entitlement after this point. If at any point I arrive for a lesson and you are not entitled to drive, or I am unable to verify that you are, the lesson will be cancelled, and I may charge up to the full lesson price you have paid.

You must inform me of any medical conditions which may make you unfit to drive. On your first lesson, I will test your eyesight by asking you to read a number plate from 20 metres away, but it is your responsibility to ensure that you otherwise meet the standards of vision for driving (https://www.gov.uk/driving-eyesight-rules). You must tell me of any changes to your eyesight that may affect your ability to meet these rules, and if you need glasses or contact lenses to meet this standard, you must where them to every lesson.

If I arrive for a lesson and deem you unfit to drive due (e.g., due to alcohol or drug use) the lesson will be cancelled, and I may charge up to the full lesson price you have paid.

If at any time on a lesson you make me feel unsafe, or I feel that you pose a danger to others, I may return you to your address and end the lesson. In this case you will be charged only for the lesson time you have already used. In the case that I don’t feel safe to return you to your address, I will end the lesson where we are, and the police will be called to ensure the safety of all parties.

## 5. Driving test bookings

If you wish to take your driving test in my car, and I agree that you may do so, this will be booked at your normal lesson rate, usually for a 2 hour session (if we are travelling to a test centre further away it may need to be longer). This price is paid to me for my time and the usage of my car, and is entirely separate to any payment made to the DVSA for conducting the test. Your obligations and terms are equivalent to a normal lesson booking.

If I need to cancel the test booking, either because I believe that you are not ready or if I am unavailable, I will do so with enough notice for you to cancel or rearrange your test without losing your test fee (currently 10 full working days). If I need to cancel later than this time, I will refund you the amount you have paid for the test. Note that these obligations only apply if I have agreed to take you to test, and a booking has been made as detailed in section 1.

If the DVSA cancel your driving test, I will not be liable for the fee paid to the DVSA. I maintain the right to charge you for the driving test session if less than 48 hours’ notice is given, per section 3 (in cases where the DVSA will not compensate you for this, and you gave me notice as early as possible, I may not charge you at my discretion).

## 6. Data and privacy

I may store the following data about you:

- Your name, date of birth and contact details, and those of any personal contacts you have shared with me (e.g. parents)
- Your driving licence details and any related medical information you have chosen to share
- Any messages you have sent to me
- Lesson booking details, and records made about the lesson or your progress
- Payments you have made

I may share this data with third-party applications used to manage the records of your lessons, bookings and payments.

Data will not be stored longer than necessary. Most data will be deleted either when you finish having lessons with me, or, if you stop booking lessons without letting me know that you will no longer be having lessons, after one year. Payment records may be stored beyond this point to satisfy requirements for tax records. Messages, along with the associated phone number and your name, may be stored beyond this point for up to 2 years for my records in the event of any complaints that may be made.

During your lesson a dash cam may be recording out of the front and back of the car, but will not show the inside of the car, and will not record audio. If at any point I wish to record video or audio of you a separate agreement will be made with you as to how that content may be used.
